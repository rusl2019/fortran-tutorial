!
! Fortran is a compiled language, which means that, once written,
! the source code must be passed through a compiler to produce a
! machine executable that can be run.
!
! To compile this program, you can use the following command:
!
!   gfortran -o hello_world hello_world.f90
!

program main

   print*, "Hello, World!"

end program main
